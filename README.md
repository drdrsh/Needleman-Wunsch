# Needleman-Wunsch
Interactive Visualization of Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm in Javascript.

You can view this code live on http://experiments.mostafa.io/public/needleman-wunsch/

The motivation behind this demo is that I had some difficulty understanding the algorithm, so to gain better understanding I decided to implement it. This is not meant for serious use, What I tried to do here is to illustrate visually how the matrix is constructed and how the algorithm works. Also I wanted to allow some freedom for the user to construct a custom path along the matrix and see how paths translate into alignment "or mis-alignments".
